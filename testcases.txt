	When testing, I started off very basic and then made the same inputs more and more complex. I tested repeated words, same words with different upper/lower case letters, repeated non-alphabetic characters, special characters ($, ', ", etc.), repeated words, and inputs that will make the code print my error statement. The format of my input/output below should be

./pointersorter inputstring
